# Wesnoth-NG Tools

The src/tools directory contains several utility programs that are compiled to individual 
executables. These are:

- **cutter**            WRITEME
- **exploder**          WRITEME
- **validator**         WRITEME
- **schema_generator**  WRITEME

To build them, their well-named targets must be provided to scons.

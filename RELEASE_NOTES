CHANGES
=======

[section="Add-ons Manager improvements"]
In this release, new sorting options have been added to the Add-ons Manager dialog to improve its usefulness. The new options allow to change the neutral sorting criterion between [i]By name[/i] (which continues to be the default), [i]By last updated[/i], and [i]By first upload[/i] (former default in all versions prior to 1.11.0); additionally, it is possible to switch between ascending and descending order. Due to UI framework limitations, these options only take effect when no column has been marked for sorting in the add-ons list.

[section="Other miscellaneous add-on management improvements"]
The Remove Add-ons dialog now displays add-ons with their real names from the add-ons server as opposed to their file/directory names with underscores removed. This is only effective for add-ons downloaded with this and future versions.

Syntax errors in .pbl files are now reported properly in the user interface instead of being misclassified as network errors.

Finally, some color key disparities between the Add-ons Manager view and the Description box (which were unintentionally using different shades of orange and green) have been fixed.

[section="Better support for multiplayer campaigns"]
A support for CampaignWML has been added for multiplayer, thus allowing to use the same campaign in both multiplayer and singleplayer. As a result of this, difficulty levels and other features of singleplayer campaigns are supported in multiplayer as well. User interface has been improved to act better upon these changes and now it supports different types of level selection and difficulties dialog for campaigns.

It is now possible (if campaign author intends) to go to the lobby in-between campaign's scenarios and easily modify sides using a user interface.

In addition, there have been numerous improvements for underlying set up of multiplayer scenario, which should enhance the general stability and give way for further improvements of multiplayer campaigns.

Finally, Legend of Wesmere campaign has been made available to play in multiplayer as a result of these changes.

[section="Multiplayer server incompatibility"]
Due to changes to server protocol, multiplayer campaigns might not work correctly for older client versions when connecting to a server in this release.
